hub based reinforcement navigation

topological fingerprints

community structure in tensors -- n-Markov models (done, see Sham Kakade)

generation of art -- surrealism -- pivot points -- scale
prediction error
zooming out quality for a story

basically, identify something unique to two things that are otherwise different

how to capture "the human experience"

open problem: specificity, one shot learning, not generality
Deepmind: place cell/grid cell model for autonomous navigation

social interaction chatroom
what would users get out of this?
paid, easy
fun? maybe only a subset are experiments
maybe make them themed and educational, like stack exchange
could perform social experiments rapidly

hubbiness of graphs -- opposite of communityness
importance of this?
gui to make an adjacency matrix for some drawing

maybe talk to google and get gchat data....
what are some hypotheses?

what if you're moving around in an HMM and you're allowed to save some statistic
then your parameters at each node are the coefficients on some function
narrow it to a functional space
can you solve for them?

kernels

yelp ideas

workflow ideas
- take 3 weeks on, no weekends, 1 week off
- work in chunks: 3 days for one project, MCM style

mathcation?
